# Lab-2-Read-AGOL
Lab 2: ESRI JS Stack - Read AGOL

Objective: To create a web map application based on Esri JS, version control with GitHub, and deploy to GitHub Pages that are able to read from ArcGIS Online.

You are about to learn how to take your existing frontend website built using Esri JS from Lab 1 (Lab 1: Frontend Development CSS/JS/HTML â€“ Making a Web Map with ArcGIS JS) and connect it to a backend based on REST and ArcGIS Online. ArcGIS Online is an easy-to-use web-based GIS data repository that provides access to a rich set of hosted datasets you can use in your web mapping applications. In this lab, you'll learn how to use the Esri JS API to connect to and access these datasets hosted on AGOL. By the end of the lab, you'll have a better understanding of how to use the Esri JS API to access data hosted on AGOL. You'll also be able to create your own web mapping applications that use the AGOL datasets. So let's get started!
